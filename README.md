## General info
This is an auto clicker I made with Python. Give it a try!
I used to use pyautogui to click, but I switched over to pynput. Pyautogui has a cps limit of 10, 10 clicks per second is very slow. Pynput has a cps of up to 2000 (might be even more, I am not sure).
## Usage
Run this command in CMD, terminal or PowerShell (if you don't already have the following modules installed):
```
pip install pynput

pip install keyboard
```
I recommend testing with this click speed tester: https://clickspeedtest.com
